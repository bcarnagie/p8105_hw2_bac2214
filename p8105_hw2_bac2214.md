# Problem 1

#### Cleaning the first dataset

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate_wider_delim(mon, "-", names = c("year","month","day")) |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
    month,
    "01" ~ "jan",
    "02" ~ "feb",
    "03" ~ "mar",
    "04" ~ "apr",
    "05" ~ "may",
    "06" ~ "jun",
    "07" ~ "jul",
    "08" ~ "aug",
    "09" ~ "sep",
    "10" ~ "oct",
    "11" ~ "nov",
    "12" ~ "dec"), year = as.double(year)) |> 
  mutate(president = case_when(
     prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
    prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
    prez_gop == 2 ~ "gop"
  )) |> select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) 
```

#### Cleaning the second dataset

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate_wider_delim(date, "/", names = c("month", "day", "year")) |> 
  select(year, month,-day, close,) |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
    month,
    "1" ~ "jan",
    "2" ~ "feb",
    "3" ~ "mar",
    "4" ~ "apr",
    "5" ~ "may",
    "6" ~ "jun",
    "7" ~ "jul",
    "8" ~ "aug",
    "9" ~ "sep",
    "10" ~ "oct",
    "11" ~ "nov",
    "12" ~ "dec")) |> mutate(year = as.double(year), year = year + 2000)
```

#### Cleaning the last dataset

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment_percentage") 
```

#### Merging the dataset

``` r
fivethirtyeight_merge = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

#### Making variables about the dataset

``` r
min_year <- fivethirtyeight_merge |> 
  select(year) |> 
  pull() |> 
  min()

max_year <- fivethirtyeight_merge |> 
  select(year) |> 
  pull() |> 
  max()

num_rows = nrow(fivethirtyeight_merge)
num_col = ncol(fivethirtyeight_merge)
```

The data contains 11 columns and 822 rows . I see that the first year of
data is 1947 while the most recent year is 2015. The `month` and `year`
variables were very important for merging the 3 datasets together. An
abbreviation wasn’t really necessary in this case, but it was good to
keep consistent naming conventions across all 3 datasets.

## Problem 2

#### Cleaning the first dataset

``` r
mr_trashwheel_df =
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") |> janitor::clean_names() |> mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30, trashwheel_name = "mr_trashwheel", year = as.double(year)) |> relocate(trashwheel_name)
```

#### Cleaning the second dataset

``` r
professor_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") |> janitor::clean_names() |> mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30, trashwheel_name = "professor_trashwheel")|> relocate(trashwheel_name)
```

#### Cleaning the last dataset

``` r
gwynnda_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L157") |>     janitor::clean_names() |> mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30, trashwheel_name = "gwynnda_trashwheel") |> relocate(trashwheel_name)
```

#### Binding all 3 datasets together

``` r
trashwheel_bind_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trashwheel_df, professor_trashwheel_df, gwynnda_trashwheel_df)
```

#### Making variables about the dataset

``` r
num_rows2 = nrow(trashwheel_bind_df)
num_col2 = ncol(trashwheel_bind_df)

na_count = trashwheel_bind_df |> 
  pull(plastic_bags) |> 
  is.na() |> 
  sum()

cigbutts_count = trashwheel_bind_df |> 
  select(plastic_bags) |> 
  pull() |> 
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```

There are 15 columns and 845 observations. I noticed that there are 1 in
the `plastic bag` variable due to the fact that `mr_trashwheel_df` and
`professor_trashwheel_df` did not collect data for this variable.
Cigarette butts seem be a huge contributor of trash, with all 3
trashwheels collecting a total of 9.13162^{5} butts total.

> For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
> Professor Trash Wheel?

``` r
professortrashwheel_total_wt = trashwheel_bind_df |> 
  select(trashwheel_name, weight_tons) |> filter(trashwheel_name == "professor_trashwheel") |> 
  pull("weight_tons") |> 
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26
tons.

> What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
> July of 2021?

``` r
gwynndatrashwheel_total_cigbutts = subset(trashwheel_bind_df,
  trashwheel_name == "gwynnda_trashwheel" &
  month == "July" &
  year == 2021) |> 
select(cigarette_butts) |> 
sum(na.rm = TRUE)  
```

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
was 1.63^{4}.

## Problem 3

Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics. Ensure
that sex and APOE4 carrier status are appropriate encoded (i.e. not
numeric), and remove any participants who do not meet the stated
inclusion criteria (i.e. no MCI at baseline). Discuss important steps in
the import process and relevant features of the dataset. How many
participants were recruited, and of these how many develop MCI? What is
the average baseline age? What proportion of women in the study are
APOE4 carriers?

#### Cleaning first dataset

``` r
mci_bl =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, 
                          0 ~ "female",
                          1 ~ "male"), 
         apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                          0 ~ "non_carrier",
                          1 ~ "carrier"),
       age_at_onset = case_when(
         age_at_onset == "." ~ "9999", # made periods a large arbitrary number
         TRUE ~ age_at_onset)) |> 
  mutate(age_condition = current_age != "." & current_age >= age_at_onset)
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

An important step for me to take when importing this datasetp was to
skip the first row. This row contained informnation about the datatset,
so I skipped it using the read_csv function so that teh first row would
be the column name. Important features in the dataset include the id
which serves as a unique identifier for each patient and age on onset,
with a missing value for this column indicating that the study
participant remained MCI throughout the study period (which we wanted to
exclude).

if they have MCI at baseline then remove them!

``` r
total_particpants_count = read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, 
                          0 ~ "female",
                          1 ~ "male"), 
         apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                          0 ~ "non_carrier",
                          1 ~ "carrier")) |> nrow()
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4

``` r
mci_count_check = nrow(mci_bl) 
```

There were 483 people recruited for the study and 483 developed mci.

> What is the average baseline age?

``` r
avg_age_bl = 
mci_bl |> 
select(current_age)
```
