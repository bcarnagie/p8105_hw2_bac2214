# Problem 1

#### Cleaning the first dataset

``` r
pols_month_df = 
  read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate_wider_delim(mon, "-", names = c("year","month","day")) |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
    month,
    "01" ~ "jan",
    "02" ~ "feb",
    "03" ~ "mar",
    "04" ~ "apr",
    "05" ~ "may",
    "06" ~ "jun",
    "07" ~ "jul",
    "08" ~ "aug",
    "09" ~ "sep",
    "10" ~ "oct",
    "11" ~ "nov",
    "12" ~ "dec"), year = as.double(year)) |> 
  mutate(president = case_when(
     prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
    prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop",
    prez_gop == 2 ~ "gop"
  )) |> select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day) 
```

#### Cleaning the second dataset

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("data/snp.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate_wider_delim(date, "/", names = c("month", "day", "year")) |> 
  select(year, month,-day, close,) |> 
  mutate(
    month = case_match(
    month,
    "1" ~ "jan",
    "2" ~ "feb",
    "3" ~ "mar",
    "4" ~ "apr",
    "5" ~ "may",
    "6" ~ "jun",
    "7" ~ "jul",
    "8" ~ "aug",
    "9" ~ "sep",
    "10" ~ "oct",
    "11" ~ "nov",
    "12" ~ "dec")) |> mutate(year = as.double(year), year = year + 2000)
```

#### Cleaning the last dataset

``` r
unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(jan:dec,
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "unemployment_percentage") 
```

#### Merging the dataset

``` r
fivethirtyeight_merge = 
  left_join(pols_month_df, snp_df) |>
  left_join(x = _, y = unemployment_df)
```

    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`
    ## Joining with `by = join_by(year, month)`

#### Making variables about the dataset

``` r
min_year <- fivethirtyeight_merge |> 
  select(year) |> 
  pull() |> 
  min()

max_year <- fivethirtyeight_merge |> 
  select(year) |> 
  pull() |> 
  max()

num_rows = nrow(fivethirtyeight_merge)
num_col = ncol(fivethirtyeight_merge)
```

The data contains 11 columns and 822 rows . I see that the first year of
data is 1947 while the most recent year is 2015. The `month` and `year`
variables were very important for merging the 3 datasets together. An
abbreviation wasn’t really necessary in this case, but it was good to
keep consistent naming conventions across all 3 datasets.

## Problem 2

#### Cleaning the first dataset

``` r
mr_trashwheel_df =
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N586") |> janitor::clean_names() |> mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30, trashwheel_name = "mr_trashwheel", year = as.double(year)) |> relocate(trashwheel_name)
```

#### Cleaning the second dataset

``` r
professor_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M108") |> janitor::clean_names() |> mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30, trashwheel_name = "professor_trashwheel")|> relocate(trashwheel_name)
```

#### Cleaning the last dataset

``` r
gwynnda_trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:L157") |>     janitor::clean_names() |> mutate(homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500)/30, trashwheel_name = "gwynnda_trashwheel") |> relocate(trashwheel_name)
```

#### Binding all 3 datasets together

``` r
trashwheel_bind_df = 
  bind_rows(mr_trashwheel_df, professor_trashwheel_df, gwynnda_trashwheel_df)
```

#### Making variables about the dataset

``` r
num_rows2 = nrow(trashwheel_bind_df)
num_col2 = ncol(trashwheel_bind_df)

na_count = trashwheel_bind_df |> 
  pull(plastic_bags) |> 
  is.na() |> 
  sum()

cigbutts_count = trashwheel_bind_df |> 
  select(plastic_bags) |> 
  pull() |> 
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```

There are 15 columns and 845 observations. I noticed that there are 1 in
the `plastic bag` variable due to the fact that `mr_trashwheel_df` and
`professor_trashwheel_df` did not collect data for this variable.
Cigarette butts seem be a huge contributor of trash, with all 3
trashwheels collecting a total of 9.13162^{5} butts total.

> For available data, what was the total weight of trash collected by
> Professor Trash Wheel?

``` r
professortrashwheel_total_wt = trashwheel_bind_df |> 
  select(trashwheel_name, weight_tons) |> filter(trashwheel_name == "professor_trashwheel") |> 
  pull("weight_tons") |> 
  sum(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 216.26
tons.

> What was the total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
> July of 2021?

``` r
gwynndatrashwheel_total_cigbutts = subset(trashwheel_bind_df,
  trashwheel_name == "gwynnda_trashwheel" &
  month == "July" &
  year == 2021) |> 
select(cigarette_butts) |> 
sum(na.rm = TRUE)  
```

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
was 1.63^{4}.

## Problem 3

#### Cleaning first dataset

``` r
mci_bl =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, 
                          0 ~ "female",
                          1 ~ "male"), 
         apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                          0 ~ "non_carrier",
                          1 ~ "carrier"),
       age_at_onset = case_when(
         age_at_onset == "." ~ "9999", # made periods a large arbitrary number
         TRUE ~ age_at_onset)) |> 
  mutate(age_condition = current_age != "." & current_age >= age_at_onset) # checking if anyone had mci prior to study enrollment 
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset
    ## dbl (5): ID, Current Age, Sex, Education, apoe4
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

An important step for me to take when importing this dataset was to skip
the first row. This row contained information about the dataset, so I
skipped it using the read_csv function so that the first row would be
the column name. Important features in the dataset include the id which
serves as a unique identifier for each patient and age on onset, with a
missing value for this column indicating that the study participant
remained MCI throughout the study period (which we wanted to exclude).
Sine the age at baseline was either missing or greater than the age of
participants at enrollment, I decided not to remove any particapnt since
all of them seemed to meet inclusion criteria of no MCI at baseline.

> How many participants were recruited, and of these how many develop
> MCI?

``` r
total_particpants_count = read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, 
                          0 ~ "female",
                          1 ~ "male"), 
         apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                          0 ~ "non_carrier",
                          1 ~ "carrier")) |> nrow()
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): Age at onset

``` r
mci_during_enrollment = read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(sex = case_match(sex, 
                          0 ~ "female",
                          1 ~ "male"), 
         apoe4 = case_match(apoe4,
                          0 ~ "non_carrier",
                          1 ~ "carrier")) |>
         filter(age_at_onset != ".") |> nrow()
```

    ## Rows: 483 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

There were 483 people recruited for the study and 97 developed mci.

> What is the average baseline age?

``` r
avg_age_bl = mci_bl |> 
pull(current_age) |> 
mean(na.rm = TRUE)
```

The average baseline age is 65.0467909.

#### Cleaning second dataset

``` r
mci_amyloid = read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) |>
   janitor::clean_names() |> 
   pivot_longer(
   baseline:time_8,
   names_to = "years_since_bl",
   values_to = "measurements",
   names_prefix = "time_"
) |> 
mutate(years_since_bl = replace(years_since_bl, years_since_bl =="baseline", "0")
) |> rename("id" = "study_id")
```

    ## Rows: 487 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (5): Baseline, Time 2, Time 4, Time 6, Time 8
    ## dbl (1): Study ID
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

#### Making info about the variables

``` r
na_count_mciamyloid = mci_amyloid |> 
  pull(measurements) |> 
  is.na() |> 
  sum()
  
mci_amyloid_rowtotal = mci_amyloid |> nrow()
```

I imported, cleaned and tidied the dataset in such a way that all
time_points are in one column instead of being split into separate
columsn for baseline,time 2, etc. I also skippied the first row because
this contained information about the dataset. There are 2435
measurements across all study participants and 163 NA values for the
measurements variable.

> Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid
> datasets.

``` r
participants_in_bl = anti_join(mci_bl,mci_amyloid, by = "id")

participants_in_amyloid = anti_join(mci_amyloid, mci_bl, by = "id")

only_inamyloid_rows = nrow(participants_in_amyloid)

only_in_bl_rows = participants_in_bl |> 
distinct(id) |> 
nrow()
```

There are 8 participants only appearing in the baseline dataset and 60
participants only in the amyloid dataset.

##### Combining baseline and amyloid datasets only with participants having data in both

``` r
mci_merge =
  inner_join(mci_bl, mci_amyloid, by = "id")
  
only_in_both_rows = mci_merge |> 
distinct(id) |> 
nrow()

mci_merge_rows = 
  mci_merge |> nrow()
```

There are 475 unique individuals with data in both datasets. The dataset
has 2375 total observations.

#### Exporting as a csv

``` r
write.csv(mci_merge, "mci_merge.csv")
```
